  - Misalignment examples:
    - Sore Throat:
      - Misaligned:
          Bob: Of course, yeah, it sounds like, you have uh a bit of a sore throat, so I hope you feel better. Thank
          Gloria: you. I appreciate it.
      - Corrected:
          Bob: Of course, yeah, it sounds like, you have uh a bit of a sore throat, so I hope you feel better.
          Gloria: Thank you. I appreciate it.
    - Real Words:
      - Misaligned:
          Bob: It's a good talent to be able to say that. It's not actually
          Gloria: you. I appreciate it.
      - Corrected:
          Bob: Of course, yeah, it sounds like, you have uh a bit of a sore throat, so I hope you feel better.
          Jim: a real word. I learned that
    - Not a misalignment: even if Jim doesn't have a complete sentence, Bob starts a new sentence, indicating that
      Bob interrupted Jim. This transcript is correct:
        Jim: Hey Bob, question. Is it your intention or your recommendation that we fill up all 22 slots next Wednesday? That would be a
        Bob: I mean, I think that is the ideal scenario.
