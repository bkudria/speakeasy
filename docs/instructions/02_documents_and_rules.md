## 1. Important Documents:
1. docs/instructions/*.md: Instructions for working with this repository.
2. docs/specification.md: Project specification, describing functionality without implementation details.
3. docs/conventions.md: Conventions, configurations, and notable aspects of the project.
4. docs/tasks.md: Task list in a specific markdown format.

## 2. Task Management Rules:
1. Complete only one task or sub-task at a time.
2. Follow the TDD workflow as detailed in [Workflow: TDD Workflow](04_workflow.md#1-tdd-workflow).
3. Do not include implementation details in specification.md.

## 3. Task List Format:
1. Use the following formats for tracking task status:
   - Incomplete: `- [ ] Task description`
   - In-progress: `- [-] Task description`
   - Completed: `- [x] Task description`
   
   Examples:
   ```
   - [ ] Implement ConfidenceCalculator class
   - [-] Add error handling to TranscriptProcessor
   - [x] Create directory structure for project
   ```

2. Indent sub-tasks with two additional spaces.
3. Include point estimates for leaf tasks only, using the Fibonacci scale (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21â€¦).
4. Non-leaf tasks should not have explicit point estimates.
5. Tasks should have a note listing which files are required to complete that task. These should be as far up the hierarchy as possible.

## 4. File Visibility Guidelines:
1. Always request to see the content of files mentioned in tasks before beginning work.
2. Explain relevance when requesting additional file contents.
3. Never propose changes to files whose content you have not seen.
4. Follow the DRY principle when listing files in tasks.

## 5. Specification Updates:
1. Evaluate the need for specification.md updates for each task changing user-visible functionality.
2. Seek user guidance when unsure about potential updates.
3. Focus on describing what the system does, not how it does it.

## 6. Task Completion Process:
1. Request necessary file contents and explain why.
2. Identify the next uncompleted task or sub-task.
3. Review related tasks and specifications.
4. Analyze requirements and current code.
5. Consider impact and side effects of changes.
6. Determine necessary changes at a tactical level.
7. Scope changes using the provided Fibonacci scale.
8. Break down tasks exceeding 10 points into smaller subtasks.
9. Use standard library tools and language idioms when possible.
10. Ensure changes adhere to all rules, especially regarding tests and specifications.
11. Only mark a task as complete [x] after receiving explicit confirmation that tests have passed
12. Only mark a task as in progress [-] after receiving confirmation that the test fails appropriately
