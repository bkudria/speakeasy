- [ ] Create Integration Tests
  - [ ] Add end-to-end tests that run the entire script with sample JSON/audio input
  - [ ] Verify all steps work together correctly

- [ ] Automate OS Detection Tests
  - [ ] Test the script's "open directory" logic on each supported OS
  - [ ] Consider using CI with different OS runners

- [ ] Thorough Error Logging with Time Stamps
  - Provide clearer debugging by including timestamps and error categories in logs.

- [ ] Write a `README.md` for end-users:
  - [ ] Explain how to install the script
  - [ ] Explain how to run and provide input
  - [ ] Show usage examples

- [ ] Add Performance Profiling
  - [ ] Identify bottlenecks in segment extraction and CSV generation
  - [ ] Use a Ruby profiling tool (e.g., ruby-prof) to measure run times
  - [ ] Summarize and report any areas needing optimization

- [ ] Generate a Code Coverage Report
  - [ ] Integrate a coverage tool (e.g., SimpleCov)
  - [ ] Include coverage reports in CI pipeline if present
  - [ ] Ensure minimal coverage thresholds for merging

- [ ] Provide Example Usage
  - [ ] Create an example folder with sample input data
  - [ ] Document expected usage flow in README or separate guide
  - [ ] Show sample output files to demonstrate typical results

- [ ] Improve Error Messages
  - [ ] Review existing error messages for clarity
  - [ ] Provide user-friendly guidance and suggested resolutions

- [ ] Create a Project Website
  - [ ] Provide a GitHub Pages or similar simple site
  - [ ] Include short guide, screenshots, and usage demos
