- [x] Document the code with comments for un-intuitive parts:
  - [x] Identify areas of the codebase suitable for documentation, and add a `TODO: document` comment
  - [x] Add a task for each comment to TODO.md, as a sibling to this task, and remove the comment
  - [x] Document the logic waiting for user to type 'go' to proceed in SpeakerIdentification
  - [x] Document how consecutive errors are handled and how it's used in CsvGenerator
  - [x] Document the creation of a temporary segments file for ffmpeg in SpeakerExtraction
  - [x] Document the assumption that 'speaker_labels' is always a Hash in TranscriptParser
  - [x] Document the nested logic checking for named vs unnamed speaker files in TranscriptProcessor

- [x] Improve Specs:
  - [x] Ensure code that prints output does not interfere with RSpec output
  - [x] Review existing spec files to identify any that can be improved or do not follow RSpec best practices
    - Add a `TODO: improve` comment in each spec or block needing improvement
  - [x] For each improvement identified with a `TODO: improve` comment, add a new sibling sub-task (i.e. add a new task
        after the one on this line) under this task describing what needs to be done, and remove the comment.
  - [x] Remove direct $stdin usage from SpeakerIdentification specs and inject test input instead
  - [x] Add thorough tests for partial/missing fields beyond standard fixture in TranscriptParser
  - [x] Test additional edge cases in CsvGenerator (e.g., empty items array)
  - [x] Add tests for configurable threshold and edge case values in LowConfidenceDetector
  - [x] Implement ffmpeg extraction tests or mock approach in SpeakerExtraction specs

- [ ] Write specs for detecting and correcting speaker mis-identifications/sentence mis-alignements in the input JSON,
      and outputting appropriate rows in the CSV:
      - We will implement the functionality later - for now, the specs should fail.
  - [ ] The specs should test that the program can detect incorrectly-labeled segments by analyzing sentence boundaries,
        using the punctuation data in the Amazon Transcribe JSON data
  - [ ] The specs should test that the program does not adjust speaker labels. Instead, the program should move sentence
        fragments to the correct speaker row, such that speakers complete their sentences
  - Generally, the mis-alignments are only one or two words. This is the case we want to fix, not the case when one speaker interrupts another.
  - If there is an ambiguous segment and the correct owner of the sentence fragment cannot be determined, the program
    may both keep the fragment in the old row, and add it to the new row. In such cases, both rows should have "review
    in their note." 
  - [ ] The specs should test that the program perform word-level confidence and overlap checks
  - [ ] The specs should test that the program performs pause and silence analysis

- [ ] Implement a "multiple speakers" note:
  - [ ] If a row's timestamps overlap with previous or subsequent rows that have different speakers, mark all involved rows with "multiple speakers" in the Note column

- [ ] As we generate each row, examine its confidence level and add a "review" note:
  - [ ] Allow multiple values in the "note" column, separated by a comma

- [ ] Provide a manual review step if mis-labeling is suspected. This step should occur after the entire CSV is written.

- [ ] Add JSON Schema Validation
  - Ensures the transcript JSON strictly follows Amazon Transcribeâ€™s structure before processing.

- [ ] Implement Logging
  - [ ] Add a configurable logging mechanism to capture debug/info/warning/error messages
  - [ ] Allow logs to be toggled or directed to a file
  - [ ] Ensure all program output (including from external `system` calls) goes through the logger, and update
        spec_helper.rb to capture logs and output them only if a spec fails, instead of mocking the global stdout/stderr
        streams.

- [ ] Add CLI Flags
  - [ ] Allow users to set options (confidence threshold, paths, skipping steps, etc.) via command-line flags
  - [ ] Provide help text for each flag

- [ ] Enhance Environmental Checks
  - [ ] Add checks for FFmpeg installation and other external dependencies
  - [ ] Guide the user if dependencies are missing

- [ ] Add Concurrency for Segment Processing
  - Reasoning: Parallelize the segment processing to speed up CSV generation for large transcripts.
  - use the ruby-concurrency gem

- [ ]
