- [ ] Write specs for detecting and correcting speaker mis-identifications/sentence mis-alignements in the input JSON,
      and outputting appropriate rows in the CSV:
  - [ ] The specs should test that the program can detect incorrectly-labeled segments by analyzing sentence boundaries,
        using the punctuation data in the Amazon Transcribe JSON data
  - [ ] The specs should test that the program does not adjust speaker labels. Instead, the program should move sentence
        fragments to the correct speaker row, such that speakers complete their sentences
  - Generally, the mis-alignments are only one or two words. This is the case we want to fix, not the case when one speaker interrupts another.
  - If there is an ambiguous segment and the correct owner of the sentence fragment cannot be determined, the program
    may both keep the fragment in the old row, and add it to the new row. In such cases, both rows should have "review
    in their note." 
  - [ ] The specs should test that the program perform word-level confidence and overlap checks
  - [ ] The specs should test that the program performs pause and silence analysis

- [ ] Implement a "multiple speakers" note:
  - [ ] If a row's timestamps overlap with previous or subsequent rows that have different speakers, mark all involved rows with "multiple speakers" in the Note column

- [ ] As we generate each row, examine its confidence level and add a "review" note:
  - [ ] Allow multiple values in the "note" column, separated by a comma

- [ ] Provide a manual review step if mis-labeling is suspected. This step should occur after the entire CSV is written.

- [ ] Add JSON Schema Validation
  - Ensures the transcript JSON strictly follows Amazon Transcribeâ€™s structure before processing.

- [ ] Implement Logging
  - [ ] Add a configurable logging mechanism to capture debug/info/warning/error messages
  - [ ] Allow logs to be toggled or directed to a file
  - [ ] Ensure all program output (including from external `system` calls) goes through the logger, and update
        spec_helper.rb to capture logs and output them only if a spec fails, instead of mocking the global stdout/stderr
        streams.

- [ ] Add CLI Flags
  - [ ] Allow users to set options (confidence threshold, paths, skipping steps, etc.) via command-line flags
  - [ ] Provide help text for each flag

- [ ] Enhance Environmental Checks
  - [ ] Add checks for FFmpeg installation and other external dependencies
  - [ ] Guide the user if dependencies are missing

- [ ] Add Concurrency for Segment Processing
  - Reasoning: Parallelize the segment processing to speed up CSV generation for large transcripts.
  - use the ruby-concurrency gem
